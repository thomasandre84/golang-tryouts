# GoLang-tryouts
Really just playing around with Go, and try out basic implementations with different libraries.
Starting at level 1

### Project setup fiber-api
```
go mod init "github.com/thomasandre84/fiber-api"
go get "gorm.io/driver/sqlite"
go get "gorm.io/gorm"
go get "gorm.io/gorm"
```

### Start the service 
in Dev Mode:
```
go run main.go
```
